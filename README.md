# SkyViewFactor calculations using a GPU accelerated methodology

Continuous Sky View Factor (SVF) Calculations via GPU-Accelerated Ray Tracing
This repository contains the implementation of a parallel GPU-based workflow for high-resolution Sky View Factor (SVF) calculations, as described in the paper "Continuous Sky View Factor calculations using a parallel GPU workflow". The method leverages NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA to perform full-hemisphere ray tracing efficiently, enabling rapid SVF estimation in complex urban and vegetated environments. Compared to conventional CPU-based techniques, this approach reduces computation time by up to 99% without sacrificing accuracy. Ideal for large-scale urban climate modeling and microclimate analyses.
